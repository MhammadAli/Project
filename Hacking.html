                <p id="1"><img src="hack.jpg" alt="cover of a book"> Hacking is the art of creative problem solving, whether that means finding an unconventional solution to a difficult problem or exploiting holes in sloppy programming. Many people call themselves
                    hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope. Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the
                    art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker's perspective. The included LiveCD provides a complete Linux
                    programming and debugging environment—all without modifying your current operating system. Use it to follow along with the book's examples as you fill gaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own. Get your hands
                    dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking network communications, bypassing protections, exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits. This book will teach you how to: – Program computers
                    using C, assembly language, and shell scripts – Corrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer overflows and format strings – Inspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger to gain a real understanding of what
                    is happening – Outsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and intrusion detection systems – Gain access to a remote server using port-binding or connect-back shellcode, and alter a server's logging behavior to hide
                    your presence – Redirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP connections – Crack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and speed up brute-force attacks using a password probability matrix Hackers are always
                    pushing the boundaries, investigating the unknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don't already know how to program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give you a complete picture of programming, machine architecture,
                    network communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine this knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you need is your own creativity.

                <p id="3"><img src="test.jpg" alt="cover of a book">Penetration testers simulate cyber attacks to find security weaknesses in networks, operating systems, and applications. Information security experts worldwide use penetration techniques to evaluate
                    enterprise defenses. In Penetration Testing, security expert, researcher, and trainer Georgia Weidman introduces you to the core skills and techniques that every pentester needs. Using a virtual machine–based lab that includes Kali
                    Linux and vulnerable operating systems, you’ll run through a series of practical lessons with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite. As you follow along with the labs and launch attacks, you’ll experience the key stages of an
                    actual assessment—including information gathering, finding exploitable vulnerabilities, gaining access to systems, post exploitation, and more. Learn how to: –Crack passwords and wireless network keys with brute-forcing and wordlists
                    –Test web applications for vulnerabilities –Use the Metasploit Framework to launch exploits and write your own Metasploit modules –Automate social-engineering attacks –Bypass antivirus software –Turn access to one machine into total
                    control of the enterprise in the post exploitation phase You’ll even explore writing your own exploits. Then it’s on to mobile hacking—Weidman’s particular area of research—with her tool, the Smartphone Pentest Framework. With its
                    collection of hands-on lessons that cover key tools and strategies, Penetration Testing is the introduction that every aspiring hacker needs.

                <p id="7"><img src="kal.jpg" alt="cover of a book">Kali Linux has not only become the information security professional's platform of choice, but evolved into an industrial-grade, and world-class operating system distribution--mature, secure, and
                    enterprise-ready. Through the decade-long development process, Muts and his team, along with countless volunteers from the hacker community, have taken on the burden of streamlining and organizing our work environment, freeing us from
                    much of the drudgery. They provided a secure and reliable foundation, allowing us to concentrate on securing our digital world. An amazing community has built up around Kali Linux. Every month, more than 300,000 of us download a version
                    of Kali. We come together in online and real-world training rooms and grind through the sprawling Offensive Security Penetration Testing Labs, pursuing the near-legendary Offensive Security certifications. We come together on the Kali
                    forums, some 40,000 strong, and hundreds of us at a time can be found on the Kali IRC channel. We gather at conferences and attend Kali Dojos to learn from the developers themselves how to best leverage Kali. However, the Kali team
                    has never released an official Kali Linux manual, until now. In this book, we'll focus on the Kali Linux platform itself, and help you understand and maximize Kali from the ground up. The developers will walk you through Kali Linux
                    features and fundamentals, provide a crash course in basic Linux commands and concepts, and then walk you through the most common Kali Linux installation scenarios. You'll learn how to configure, troubleshoot and secure Kali Linux
                    and then dive into the powerful Debian package manager. Throughout this expansive section, you'll learn how to install and configure packages, how to update and upgrade your Kali installation, and how to create your own custom packages.
                    Then you'll learn how to deploy your custom installation across massive enterprise networks. Finally, you'll be guided through advanced topics such as kernel compilation, custom ISO creation, industrial-strength encryption, and even
                    how to install crypto kill switches to safeguard your sensitive information. Whether you're a veteran or an absolute n00b, this is the best place to start with Kali Linux, the security professional's platform of choice.

                <p id="9"><img src="play.jpg" alt="cover of a book">Back for the third season, The Hacker Playbook 3 (THP3) takes your offensive game to the pro tier. With a combination of new strategies, attacks, exploits, tips and tricks, you will be able to
                    put yourself in the center of the action toward victory. The main purpose of this book is to answer questions as to why things are still broken. For instance, with all the different security products, secure code reviews, defense in
                    depth, and penetration testing requirements, how are we still seeing massive security breaches happening to major corporations and governments? The real question we need to ask ourselves is, are all the safeguards we are putting in
                    place working? This is what The Hacker Playbook 3 - Red Team Edition is all about. By now, we are all familiar with penetration testing, but what exactly is a Red Team? Red Teams simulate real-world, advanced attacks to test how well
                    your organization's defensive teams respond if you were breached. They find the answers to questions like: Do your incident response teams have the right tools, skill sets, and people to detect and mitigate these attacks? How long
                    would it take them to perform these tasks and is it adequate? This is where you, as a Red Teamer, come in to accurately test and validate the overall security program. THP3 will take your offensive hacking skills, thought processes,
                    and attack paths to the next level. This book focuses on real-world campaigns and attacks, exposing you to different initial entry points, exploitation, custom malware, persistence, and lateral movement--all without getting caught!
                    This heavily lab-based book will include multiple Virtual Machines, testing environments, and custom THP tools.</p><br><br>

                    antivirus software, social engineering relies on human fault to gain access to sensitive spaces; in this book, renowned expert Christopher Hadnagy explains the most commonly-used techniques that fool even the most robust security personnel,
                    and shows you how these techniques have been used in the past. The way that we make decisions as humans affects everything from our emotions to our security. Hackers, since the beginning of time, have figured out ways to exploit that
                    decision making process and get you to take an action not in your best interest. This new Second Edition has been updated with the most current methods used by sharing stories, examples, and scientific study behind how those decisions
                    are exploited. Networks and systems can be hacked, but they can also be protected; when the “system” in question is a human being, there is no software to fall back on, no hardware upgrade, no code that can lock information down indefinitely.
                    Human nature and emotion is the secret weapon of the malicious social engineering, and this book shows you how to recognize, predict, and prevent this type of manipulation by taking you inside the social engineer’s bag of tricks. Examine
                    the most common social engineering tricks used to gain access Discover which popular techniques generally don’t work in the real world Examine how our understanding of the science behind emotions and decisions can be used by social
                    engineers Learn how social engineering factors into some of the biggest recent headlines Learn how to use these skills as a professional social engineer and secure your company Adopt effective counter-measures to keep hackers at bay
                    By working from the social engineer’s playbook, you gain the advantage of foresight that can help you protect yourself and others from even their best efforts. Social Engineering gives you the inside information you need to mount an

                    produced audiobook and accompanying online application that will improve your health for years to come. While Tom's bestsellers on strengths and well-being have inspired more than 5 million people in the last decade, Eat Move Sleep
                    reveals his greatest passion and expertise. Quietly managing a serious illness for more than 20 years, Tom has assembled a wide range of information on the impact of eating, moving, and sleeping. Written and narrated by Tom Rath in

                    But few realize the health consequences they are suffering as a result of modernity's increasingly sedentary lifestyle, or the effects it has had on society at large. In Get Up! , health expert James A. Levine's original scientific
                    research shows that today's chair-based world, where we no longer use our bodies as they evolved to be used, is having negative consequences on our health, and is a leading cause of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Over the decades,
                    humans have moved from a primarily active lifestyle to one that is largely sedentary, and this change has reshaped every facet of our lives―from social interaction to classroom design. Levine shows how to throw off the shackles of
                    inertia and reverse these negative trends through simple changes in our daily lives.</p><br>

                <p id="3"><img src="move.jpg" alt="cover of a book">Want to live longer and be healthier? Your body is designed to move, not sit. Not sure how to start? This book teaches you how to reap the benefits of being less sedentary without sweating it out
                    at the gym. Your better body comes from forming better habits. You have the power to build a healthier you today by moving more. Your life depends on it. And it’s not nearly as much work as you think. As a personal trainer and founder
                    of The Move More Institute™, Amanda Sterczyk knows that if you love your body, you need to move your body. This book will help you change your habits by teaching you how to add more movement to your day. That's right—movement, which
                    is another way to say light physical activity. Physical activity doesn't need to be costly, time-consuming, or even sweaty. But it does need to happen. Every. Single. Day. The research is unequivocal: A sedentary lifestyle is hazardous
                    to your health. Physical inactivity has been identified by the World Health Organization as the fourth biggest risk factor for global mortality, behind high blood pressure, tobacco use, and high blood sugar. Labour-saving devices and
                    apps have reduced the need for us to get up and move, which is bad news for our health. The good news is that adding more movement to your day isn’t complicated. With the guidance provided in this book, you can: - Learn how to nudge
                    yourself to be more active throughout the day, every day - Improve your health by incorporating non-exercise activity into your busy workday, and - Identify and overcome barriers to being more physically active. The book is divided
                    into three easy to follow sections: The Problem, The Solution, and The Action Plan. If you’re stuck and not sure what to do, this book will help you change your behaviour from "mostly sedentary" to "active mover.” If you like self-help
                    books that are light-hearted, humorous, and helpful, then you’ll love Amanda Sterczyk’s guide to get you moving more. For example, you’ll learn how fainting at a wedding validates the need to keep our chairs and that there are some
                    occasions when sitting is preferable to standing.

                    movement that challenges the force of gravity. Citing her original NASA research on how weightlessness weakens astronauts' muscles, bones, and overall health, the author presents a simple and effective plan for maintaining good health
                    throughout life by developing new lifestyle habits of frequent gravity-challenging movement. Written for everyone who spends most of their lives sitting in chairs, at desks, and in cars, this practical, easy-to-follow action plan outlines
                    simple gravity-challenging activities such as standing up frequently, stretching, walking, and dancing that are more healthful and effective than conventional diet and exercise regimens.</p><br><br>

                    champion. With a foreword by New York Times bestselling author Dr. Joseph Mercola. Achieve more with less effort: The secret to weight loss, fitness, and wellness lies in the most basic and most overlooked function of your body—how
                    you breathe. One of the biggest obstacles to better health and fitness is a rarely identified problem: chronic over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we need—without realizing it—contributing to poor health and fitness,
                    including a host of disorders, from anxiety and asthma to insomnia and heart problems. In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000 people—including Olympic and professional athletes—in reduced breathing exercises now
                    shares his scientifically validated techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) to
                    determine how efficiently your body uses oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and professional
                    athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss, and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve cardio-fitness. Following his program, even the most out-of-shape person (including those with chronic respiratory conditions such
                    as asthma) can climb stairs, run for a bus, or play soccer without gasping for air, and everyone can achieve: Easy weight loss and weight maintenance Improved sleep and energy Increased concentration Reduced breathlessness during exercise
                    Heightened athletic performance Improved cardiovascular health Elimination of asthmatic symptoms, and more. With The Oxygen Advantage, you can look better, feel better, and do more—it’s as easy as breathing.</p>

                    touch with their bodies―and especially their breathing―than ever before. Ironically, athletes and others who pride themselves on taking care of their bodies actually put themselves at greater risk. Why? Because they’re asking their
                    body to take on next-level demands, but failing at life’s most essential skill: efficient breathing. Proper breathing is the world’s most powerful biohack. Learning it will help you feel better, avoid injury, and perform at your very
                    best (including in bed!). Champion gladiators, master martial artists, even spearfishers all had one thing in common: efficient breathing to achieve flawless execution. An elite few still understand: Navy SEALs who need to make the
                    perfect shot, super-elite weightlifters who truly understand how to harness and channel their energy, free-divers who can spend seemingly impossible amounts of time underwater, and high-profile execs who keep calm before multi-billion-dollar

                    against aging with a personalized fitness program that's right for you. Whatever your fitness goals or preferences, this book is designed to help you pursue the health program that works for you. An inspirational speaker, author, and
                    former Wall Street rainmaker, Jim Owen was 70 when he decided he had to get fit. Years of a chair-bound lifestyle were taking their toll. Realizing that the old bodybuilding approach was no way to tackle the stiffness, weakness, and
                    aches and pains that come with age, he set off on a journey of discovery and transformation. With help from the experts, he developed a common-sense, step-by-step program that can be tailored to any level of physical ability. Along
                    the way he learned why cardio machines aren't enough, what it takes to be "functionally fit" for daily life, and how to stay motivated. Today, Owen is in better shape than he was at 25, and he is a passionate evangelist for fitness
                    as a way of life. He has proved that you don't have to be powerless in the face of advancing years: if you make a commitment to "just move," you can take charge of the aging process and make your coming years the best they can be.
                    The book is divided into two sections, with the first providing fascinating information and the second showing step-by-step details of how to put the best fitness principles into practice.</p>
